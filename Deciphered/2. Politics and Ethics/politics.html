        <h3 id="z1.0"> The DMCA </h3>
        <p> The DMCA: The DMCA was a group of amendments and additions to title 17 (and one on title 28), signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1998. These amendments updated U.S. copyright law to include the internet in it's restrictions, with a few key differences between it and previous law.
        </p><p>
		The DMCA (digital millennium copyright act) is also one of modern day’s most important and influential federal laws. It has been absolutely essential for the rise of the internet age, and without it there would be no youtube, facebook, google, or any other application essential for today’s connected world. 
		<h4>So what does it do?</h4>
		<p>
Well, as it is a collection of amendments, the DMCA does quite a few things. Perhaps the key amendment in the entire law, however, is their notice-and-takedown provision. This law states that if a company sees their copyrighted content on a website, and that content does not fall into “fair use”, they can issue a takedown-notice to whoever posted that content onto the website. The important part to this, however, is that the website that was used to post the content is not in violation of the law. More simply put, content providers are not responsible for their users content. This simple exception is the reason facebook and youtube can survive without being sued into oblivion, even though thousands of posts containing copyrighted material are added every day. 
</p><p>
But let's talk about fair use, as the whole digital copywriting system is incredibly corrupt. 
</p><p>
The current definition of fair use reads as follows: 
<blockquote>
“the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—<br>
1: the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<br>
2: the nature of the copyrighted work; <br>
3: the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;<br>
4: the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.”</blockquote>
     <p>
      Seems pretty simple, right? Any educational, commentary-focused, criticism, or research based content is allowed to use copyrighted material, as all that is fair use. The problem, however, comes with the wording of the notice and takedown law. Specifically, the part that says you can only issue a takedown notice if you provide: “A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.” This means that takedowns occur solely on belief, not on proof. Now, of course, the law does provide a statue for counterclaims if you believe your work was claimed unfairly, however the counterclaim law says: “If the subscriber serves a counter notification complying with statutory requirements, including a statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed or disabled through mistake or misidentification, then unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the subscriber, the service provider must put the material back up within 10-14 business days after receiving the counter notification.”
      </p><p>
This can be devastating. Firstly, for many online content providers (journalists, youtubers, podcast producers), the first 10-14 days can be absolutely critical for their products success. This means that if a major company wanted a youtuber (for example) to not use their product, all the company would have to do is consistently claim copyright strikes on that youtuber’s videos. It wouldn’t even matter if those claims were valid or not, as damage is done either way. 
</p><p>
Secondly, there is the problem of court expenses. If there is a counterclaim from a regular content producer online, all a major media company has to do is take that producer to court. Court is expensive, and it would be a major risk attempting to defend oneself, even if the initial copyright claim is completely false. There are many examples of big media companies silencing critics by either taking them to court, or letting the critics back down on their own.
</p><p>
So fair use is messy, from both a definition standpoint and an abuse standpoint. Companies walk all over it, while media producers rely on it for protection. It is, however, still important for media produced on the internet today, and despite it’s flaws it has allowed art, journalism, and other media on the internet to flourish.

        <h3 id="z2.0"> The ECPA </h3>
        <p>
        	
        	While less of consequence than the DMCA, the ECPA, or Electronic Communications Privacy Act, is very important to our online security. The law extends the prohibition of communications stealing (like wiretapping) of citizens to include online data. The act is split into three parts, with several amendments updating clauses to include modern day devices and equipment. 
        	</p><p>
			<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119">Title One </a> of the act prohibits any individual, corperation, or trust from intentionally intercepting, using, or disclosing any wire, oral, or electronic communication. It also prohibits the distribution of intercepting devices, and the use of intercepted communication in the court of law. There is, however, a statute that a judge can enact to give certain permissions to intercept communications in the event of certain illegal activities. This title is key to our privacy online, and should be kept in mind when talking about the data and info that large social media sites collect. 
			</p><p>
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121">Title Two </a> is simpiler than title one. It outlines punishments for those breaking the laws imposed previously, while also reading out exceptions to the no intercepting rule. For example, this title says that the government can request communications from companies for very specific reasons in the first 180 days after said communications, and less specific reasons after 180 days. 
</p><p>
It also has this scary note: “A governmental entity acting under section 2703(b)(2) may include in its subpoena or court order a requirement that the service provider to whom the request is directed create a backup copy of the contents of the electronic communications sought in order to preserve those communications. Without notifying the subscriber or customer of such subpoena or court order, such service provider shall create such backup copy as soon as practicable consistent with its regular business practices and shall confirm to the governmental entity that such backup copy has been made.” making it legal for the government to take back-up copies of user’s data without their permission. Granted, it still has to have a court order to do so, but it is still an unsettling piece of legislature. 
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-II/chapter-206">Title Three</a> again deals with communications equipment, this time in the form of the pen register, a device that traces numbers dialed on a phone (not the calls themselves). It details how, similar to title two, the government has to get a court-order for these before installing them onto phones. 
</p><p>
And that’s the ECPA! There have been a few additions and changes to this law, and it was instated back in 1986, but it remains very relevant in today's society. 

        </p>
        <h3 id="z3.0"> The FCC &#38; net neutrality</h3>
        <h4>The original FCC &#38; the communications act of 1934</h4>
        <p>
In the thirties, the American communications were dominated by one company - the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). In 1934, the Communications Act was passed, replacing the previous FRC (Federal Radio Commission) with the FCC and breaking up the NBC monopoly. The Communications Act aimed at regulation all things communication. In the thirties, it covered “wire and radio”, but today it encompasses everything from cable and satellite television to (most importantly) the internet.
</p><p>
If you want to learn more about net neutrality itself, I would recommend you refer to our <a href="../4. Blog/blog_post_080817.html">net neutrality article</a> in the ethics section. Here, we will discuss the actual impact and meaning of the Communications Act, without having to read through 300+ pages of fancy political jargon.
</p><p>

<h4> What is the communications act? </h4>
<p>
	The original goal of the Communications Act of 1934 was to create infrastructure for regulating future communications industries. It formed the FCC, an independent government agency (meaning, it exists outside the realm of the federal executive departments and thus mostly out of the president’s control) to regulate future communications industries. Throughout the years, amendments have been passed, adding to the list of technologies covered by the FCC. It monitors everything from rates and terms of subscriber service to industry competition and standards. 
</p>

<h4> How does this stuff impact me, specifically?</h4>
<p>
	Well, the Communications Act regulates the internet as we know it. All communications companies are classified by the act as Title I, Title II, Title III, and so forth. Currently, all internet service providers are classified as Title II. However, FCC chairman Ajit Pai is trying to change this. He wants to classify ISPs as Title I communications companies instead. This would be a devastating blow to net neutrality and the open internet.
	</p><p>
Title II of the communications act has some important regulations that keeps our ISPs from messing with Net Neutrality. Under section 202:
</p>
<blockquote>It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.
</blockquote>
<p>
	This one paragraph prevents paid prioritization. In essence, this ensures that an ISP cannot give different service for different companies. This prevents an ISP from favoring their own service over a third-party service, or from requiring companies to pay for faster service. 
		  </p>

<h4> Why would anyone want us to lose net neutrality?</h4>
<p>
	Well, if you look at it from the point of view of ISPs, they have much to gain. To begin, they would instate paid prioritization, forcing large companies to pay more money. For example, if netflix chose not to pay a premium, ISPs could throttle their subscribers’ connection to netflix, encouraging their customers to use other streaming services. Thus, in order for netflix to continue high speed streaming, they would have to pay massive fees to ISPs. 
	Furthermore, the ISPs could do something called “zero-rating”. And in fact, this has been something that providers have been doing for a while now, but it is currently being policed by the FCC. Just this year, AT&#38;T launched a product called “DirecTV Now”, which allows users to stream content from DirecTV Now without containing it as data usage. By making this service free for subscribers, AT&#38;T kills tv-streaming competitors. Furthermore, if ISPs are removed from being under Title II, AT&#38;T could throttle other streaming services, making sure that everyone only used their services.
	Without Net Neutrality, the ISPs would no longer simply be a path through which we access the internet, but a gatekeeper that checks all traffic and allows it, slows it down, or completely removes it. The ISP would be in full control of what we all see on our computers, what we can access and what we can do on the internet. They would force us to pay more for what we have currently for free.
