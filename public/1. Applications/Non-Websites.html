  <p>
    As any Fromsoft game or crash course history can show us, humanity lives in a constantly repeating cycle. From the social cycle theory to the average American workday, many aspects of modern society fall into this pattern. One of modern societies most important aspects, the internet, is currently stuck in perhaps the most prevalent cycle of all - the constant tug-of-war between freedom and safety.
  </p> <p> Let’s take a step back. How is this a tug of war?
  </p> <p> Well, you’ve probably heard of the social contract before. Put simply, it’s the idea that by placing some restraints on human behavior, it makes it possible for humanity to live in a community, which in turn moves society further both socially and morally. Within this community, our mental freedom to think differently than others has actually expanded, even if we are held subject to some higher power (government).

			<h3 id="z1.0">
				Wait, there’s more than just the internet?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Surprisingly, yes.
			</p>
			<h3 id="z2.0">
				What are some common vulnerabilities of a computer?
			</h3>
			<h4 id="z2.1">
				What's the different between Physical and Internet Safety?
			</h4>
			<p>
				To preface this: just like in most (not all) other aspects of cybersecurity, it is exceedingly important to think about passwords from the perspective of both the computer and the human. Computers compute things - it's literally what they’re named for. This means that your password sucks.
			</p>
			<p>
			I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but better me than some malicious 16 year old who just figured out you could brute force a 7 letter password off a cheap laptop in a few hours.
			Because that would just be embarrassing.

			</p>
			<p>
				Lets clear up a misconception right off the bat: Hackers do not “guess” your password.
				There isn’t a league of evil, masked villains guessing that you used your dog’s name to access your email. Just like in encryption (hyperlink), the password you use to access your favorite social networking site is not stored in some big database, ripe for the taking. In reality, they are manipulated, added to, and converted to a hash (explanation on what that is), before they are stored in that database. All hackers need to do is compare thousands of other basic passwords with that database and see if those hashes match.

			</p>
			<p>
				This is why letters, numbers, and the case of your password really don’t matter all that much. Sure, they add a little extra security, but in the end they are almost as easy to brute force your way through.

			</p>
			<p>
				This is the key to creating a good password: What the password is doesn’t matter, as long as it isn’t too common or can’t be found out of a dictionary. All that really matters is the length.
				Ok, time for an example.

			</p>
			<p>
				You are a supervillain. You’re chilling in your giant lair, scheming evil plots, when a hacker (represented as a hero) rudely knocks at your door, demanding that you stop your evil ways. Now, it's not a good idea to think of hackers as good guys, but this is my example, and I can do what I want.
			</p>
			<p>
				This superhero is powerful. Far more powerful than you - he could destroy you in seconds and take your money and uncover your secret plots if you two met face to face.
				But you have a plan!

			</p>
			<p>
				To prevent the hero from getting to your lair, you have decided to build a giant maze. You know the way through this maze - you’re the one who built it! But the hero has no clue. This maze is, of course, your password.

			</p>
			<p>
				Now, when making the maze, you don’t want to make it simple. A maze with just one branching path and one turn (a password like qwerty) is easy to figure out. The hero would get through without even breaking a sweat. You gotta add some twists (numbers) and turns (!@#$%) into your maze, and make it harder for the hero to try all the potential paths.
			</p>
			<p>
				But you also have to make the maze long. A three foot maze, no matter how many twists or turns it has, is hard to get through. In the same way, a 6 letter password is easy to figure out - just try out all (26^6 = 308915776) the possibilities, from aaaaaa to zzzzzz (this is called a brute force attack). One of them is bound to be right. It seems like a lot, but going at 1000 possibilities per second (easy for a 16 year old to do on any cheap computer) would only take around 86 hours, or 3 and a half days. Now, add 10 numbers and 16 extra characters, and that 16 year old has just started junior year and has begun to re-think his life decisions. Make that password 7 words long and suddenly that 16 year old hacker has had children, gone through a midlife crisis, and gone to counseling for his turbulent, crime-filled days as a youth.

			</p>
			<p> <i> So 7 words long seems like a lot, right? Pretty safe?</i> </p>
			<p>
				Well, an actual hacker could brute force a 7 letter password in 15 minutes.
				Trillions of tries per hour. Entire indexes of common passwords all checked immediately, the entire dictionary attempted in less than a second.

			</p>
			<p>
				The kinds of hackers that end up stealing info have this kind of access - they know your tricks. The only way to stop them is to make a long password - simple as that.

			</p>
			<p>
				But as Edward Snowden says in
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc">this </a>

				illuminating John Oliver piece, it might be better to stop calling them pass words, and start calling them pass phrases.

				What is Cloud Computing and Cloud Storage?
			</h3>
			<p>
				First of all, “the cloud” - an abstract term that doesn’t really tell us much. In reality, the cloud is just another location to store or process information. In these locations, cloud-based companies provide a multitude of online-services. Massive buildings (“data centers”) house dedicated servers and storage. For the majority of us, we can’t see the physical hardware of the cloud, but we can access it from our computers.
			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.1">
				Cloud Storage vs Cloud Computing: The different
			</h4>
			<p>
				Cloud storage simply provides an external location to store your files. Using any computer, you can connect to their network and access their servers or storage remotely. As a result, you don’t have to worry about constantly emptying your hard drive or keeping track of your files - they’re all managed by a company. Furthermore, your data is often backed up multiple times, safeguarding your data against both physical and cyber-threats.
				<br />
				Common companies utilizing cloud storage: Dropbox or Google Drive.

			</p>
			<p>
				Cloud computing is similar, in that people must connect to a remote network. As a result, they can access the computing power of numerous computers, along with advanced software without having to maintain it themselves.
				<br />
				Common companies powered by cloud computing: Facebook and Gmail.
			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.2">
				Why is it useful?
			</h4>
			<p>
				For the individual:
				<br />
			- An individual can ensure their information is being backed up and won’t be lost. If it was stored on a computer hard drive, a computer malfunction could cause loss of data. However, cloud storage services have multiple different physical locations with full backups, ensuring data will not be lost.
				<br />
			- Moreover, cloud-based companies can provide resources not afforded for the common individual, especially surrounding security - cloud storage companies utilize advanced encryption techniques for securing information and substantial physical protection to defend the data centers.

			</p>
			<p>
				For a company:
				<br />
			- The cloud allows access to substantial and widespread networks without needing to pay for hardware maintenance. Normally, a company may have to devote time to ensuring applications are up to date and server hardware is functioning. With cloud computing, this is managed by the service provider.
				<br />
			- Utilizing the cloud also can provide flexibility. Due to the fact that everything is hosted online, one can access and utilize the cloud from anywhere, not just at work. Cloud computing allows employees to work from anywhere.

			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.3">
				Hard Drive vs Cloud Storage: Pros and Cons of each
			</h4>
			<p>
				There are advantages to both. To begin, hard drive storage are fast and local. As a result, you can quickly back-up information and store the physical drive somewhere safe. There is absolutely no chance of getting hacked (unless someone literally comes into your room and takes it, but I wouldn’t count that as hacking), however there is the risk of a hard drive failure and losing your data. In comparison, cloud storage is always ongoing and reliable, often more cost-efficient and utilizes advanced encryption to ensure your data is safe. Both have advantages, both have disadvantages.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a in-depth guide for what to buy, use <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2451774/cloud-storage-vs-external-hard-drives-which-really-offers-the-best-bang-for-your-buck.html"> this</a>.

			</p>

			<p>
				Most have heard the advantages - cost reduction, more flexibility, better productivity -  and are shifting towards using the cloud. In fact, according to the “State of the Cloud Survey”, 95% of survey participants are using the cloud. However, is it safe?
			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.4">
				Is it safe?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Surprisingly, yes. Up to now, no major cloud provider has been successfully attacked. But upon further thought, it makes sense. Most common vulnerabilities come from un-updated software and lack of extensive monitoring of one’s servers. These two factors make up the majority of the hacks for common companies. However, with major cloud providers, security is the first priority. As a result, the cloud is constantly being monitored for vulnerabilities. As soon as a flaw is seen, it is patched. All applications are updated quickly, removing the opportunity for malware attacks.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there is something to watch out for. Often, cloud companies offer the opportunity for your data to be encrypted as it is stored. And obviously, for any sensitive data, this should be the case. Yet, many companies overlook the options (one of which is the encrypted data). This has led to massive leaks, most notably the NRC leak, where the data of nearly 200 million voters was leaked. The lesson to be learned? Cloud computing is as safe as you make it to be.

			</p>
			<h3 id="z4.0">
				WiFi Networks
			</h3>
			<h4 id="z4.1">
				What is a WiFi network?
			</h4>
			<p>
				First off, Wi-Fi does not stand for “wireless fidelity”. It happens to rhyme with Hi-Fi, but has little to no relation. Most simply, Wi-Fi allows a computer to communicate with a network using radio frequency. Due to the fact that the frequency is being transmitted through air (and not in a wire), anyone can intercept your communications.
			</p>
			<h4 id="z4.2">
				How can it be unsafe?
			</h4>
			<p>
				Especially when using public wifi networks, all of your network traffic could be watched. When connecting to open or public wifi networks, anyone else can also go onto the wifi. As a result, someone else could read/modify your data. These dangers could manifest themselves in a couple of different ways:
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>
				1. Evil Twins
				</b>
				<br />
				These are Wi-Fi networks that portray themselves as legitimate. However, they are malicious Wi-Fi networks that are simply named after a reputable company.
				<br />
				<b>
				2. Read the fine print
				</b>
				<br />
				Often by agreeing to the terms and conditions for wifi, you give permission to the Wi-Fi owner to track your actions.
				<br />
				<b>
				3. Lack of legal obligations
				</b>
				<br />
				If you install the applications of stores (Walmart for example), you give them rights to snoop on you.
				<br />
				<b>
				4. They don’t need to protect you
				</b>
				<br />
				If you get attacked, it cannot be legally blamed on the Wi-Fi network.
			</p>
			<h4 id="z4.3">
				Personal WiFi Networks
			</h4>
			<p>
				Now, these can be better. However, you’re still transmitting data over air that can be looked at. The best way to protect your Wi-Fi network is to utilize encrypted transmissions. The current standard is WPA-3, which will help maintain security for home Wi-Fi networks. Also, when in doubt, use a VPN (especially for high-security items).

			</p>
			<h3 id="z5.0">
				How do big companies store your data?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Google receives over 20 petabytes of data every day - enough gigabytes that you have to use scientific notation to write it: 2*10^7Gb.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is an absolutely <b>ridiculous</b> amount of data, and google stores all of it, most with 2-3 backups.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may have heard of one of google's 15 data centers; massive borg-like complexes scattered across the world. Even looking at pictures gives one a sense of impossible scale - a physical representation of the vastness of the internet.
				They’re safe, too. Facebook, Google, Reddit, Amazon: all of these companies have huge storage centers backed up multiple times over. When they receive your data, it is archived in one of millions of spreadsheets and other documents, able to quickly be recalled when needed. Facebook's data store, Scuba, creates and deletes millions of rows per second. Google spends billions - yes, billions - on its data center construction and maintenance. While you can’t always trust what they’ll do with your data (hyperlink to privacy), you can completely trust that your data will be safe from deletion.
