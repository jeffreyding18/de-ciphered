				What are some common vulnerabilities of a computer?

			<h4 id="z2.1">
				What's the different between Physical and Internet Safety?

			<p>
        To preface this: just like in most (not all) other aspects of cybersecurity, it is exceedingly important to think about passwords from the perspective of both the computer and the human. Computers compute things - it's literally what they’re named for. But it's the humans that think up the password.
			</p>
      <p>
      And there is a sad universal truth when it comes to human-generated passwords.
      </p>
			<p>
        Your password sucks.
			</p>
      <p>
      I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but better me than some malicious 16 year old who just figured out you could brute force a 7 letter password off a cheap laptop in a few hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because that would just be embarrassing.
      </p>
			<p>
				Lets clear up a misconception right off the bat: Hackers do not “guess” your password.
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn’t a league of evil, masked villains guessing that you used your dog’s name to access your email. Just like in encryption (hyperlink), the password you use to access your favorite social networking site is not stored in some big database, ripe for the taking. In reality, they are manipulated, added to, and converted to a hash (explanation on what that is), before they are stored in that database. All hackers need to do is compare thousands of other basic passwords with that database and see if those hashes match.

			</p>
			<p>
				This is why letters, numbers, and the case of your password really don’t matter all that much. Sure, they add a little extra security, but in the end they are almost as easy to brute force your way through.

			</p>
			<p>
        This is the key to creating a good password: What the password is doesn’t matter, as long as it isn’t too common or can’t be found out of a dictionary. All that really matters is length and a little complexity.
			</p>

			<p> A 6 letter password is easy to figure out - just try out all (26^6 = 308915776) of the possibilities, from aaaaaa to zzzzzz (this is called a brute force attack). One of them is bound to be right. It seems like a lot, but going at 1000 possibilities per second (easy for a 16 year old to do on any $2000 home-built computer) would only take around 86 hours, or 3 and a half days. Now, add 10 numbers and 16 extra characters (!@#$%) to the list of possible inputs, and that 16 year old has just started junior year and has begun to re-think his life decisions. Make that password 7 letters long and suddenly that 16 year old hacker has had children, gone through a midlife crisis, and gone to counseling for his turbulent, crime-filled days as a youth. </p>
      <p>
      Even 7 letters long is not enough, though. Someone with experience and knowledge could brute force a 7 letter password in 15 minutes. With the right method, hackers could run through trillions of tries per hour.
      </p>
      The only way to stop them is to make a long password - simple as that. Not 7 letters - not even 10. When thinking about password creation, you want to think of length in terms of <strong>words</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of your favorite phrase from a book or movie or song, and use that. Maybe GetYourHandsOffMeYouDamnDirtyApe or There’sAMillionThingsIHaven’tDoneJustYouWait. Using phrases like this makes your password both safe and memorable (please don't use the two examples we just gave, though. That's happened too many times).
      </p>
			<p>
				As Edward Snowden says in this illuminating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGzB-yYKcc">John Oliver piece</a>, it might be better to stop calling them pass words, and start calling them pass phrases.
			</p>
			<h3 id="z3.0">
				What is Cloud Computing and Cloud Storage?
			</h3>
			<p>
        First of all, “the cloud” - an abstract term that doesn’t really tell us much. In reality, the cloud is just another location to store or process information. In these locations, cloud-based companies provide a multitude of online-services. Massive buildings (“data centers”) house dedicated servers and storage. For the majority of us, we can’t see the physical hardware of the cloud, but we can access it from our computers.
			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.1">
        What is the difference between cloud storage and cloud computing?
			</h4>
			<p>
        Cloud storage simply provides an external location to store your files. Using any computer, you can connect to their network and access their servers or storage remotely. As a result, you don’t have to worry about constantly emptying your hard drive or keeping track of your files - they’re all managed by a company. Furthermore, your data is often kept secure and backed up multiple times, safeguarding your data against both physical and cyber-threats.
        <br />
				Common companies providing cloud storage: Dropbox or Google Drive.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cloud computing is similar, in that people must connect to a remote network. The difference between the two is what that network is used for. In cloud computing, the network is used as another computer instead of just an extra hard drive. As a result, they can access the computing power of numerous computers, along with advanced software without having to maintain it themselves. Major companies powered by cloud computing are Facebook and Gmail.
				<br />
				Common companies powered by cloud computing: Facebook and Gmail.
        <br />
        Cloud computing providers: Amazon EC2.
			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.2">
				Why is it useful?
			</h4>
			<p>
				For the individual:
				<br />
        - An individual can ensure their information is being backed up and won’t be lost. If it was stored on a computer hard drive, a computer malfunction could cause loss of data. However, cloud storage services have multiple different physical locations with full backups, ensuring data will never be lost.
        <br />
        - Moreover, cloud-based companies can provide resources not afforded for the common individual, especially surrounding security - cloud storage companies utilize advanced encryption techniques for securing information and substantial physical protection to defend the data centers.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a company:
				<br />
			- The cloud allows access to substantial and widespread networks without needing to pay for hardware maintenance. Normally, a company may have to devote time to ensuring applications are up to date and server hardware is functioning. With cloud computing, this is managed by the service provider.
				<br />
			- Utilizing the cloud also can provide flexibility. Due to the fact that everything is hosted online, one can access and utilize the cloud from anywhere, not just at work. Cloud computing allows employees to work from anywhere.
        <br />
      - Cloud is secure: major cloud companies manage the security, letting small businesses focus on other areas.
        <br />
      - Cloud computing also allows access to incredibly advanced computers for a comparatively cheap price.

			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.3">
				Hard Drive vs Cloud Storage: Pros and Cons of each
			</h4>
			<p>
        There are advantages to both. To begin, hard drive storage are fast and local. As a result, you can quickly back-up information and store the physical drive somewhere safe. There is absolutely no chance of getting hacked (unless someone literally comes into your room and takes it, but that’s a different kind of hacking), however there is the risk of a hard drive failure and losing your data. In comparison, cloud storage is always ongoing and reliable, often more cost-efficient and utilizes advanced encryption to ensure your data is safe - but it is also usually subscription based, requires internet, and is often slower than an HDD. Both have advantages, both have disadvantages.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>

			<p>
				Most have heard the advantages - cost reduction, more flexibility, better productivity -  and are shifting towards using the cloud. In fact, according to the “State of the Cloud Survey”, 95% of survey participants are using the cloud. However, is it safe?
			</p>
			<h4 id="z3.4">
				Is it safe?
			</h4>
			<p>
        Surprisingly, yes. Up to now, no major cloud provider has been successfully attacked. It makes sense when you consider why. Most common vulnerabilities come from un-updated software and lack of extensive monitoring of one’s servers - the two main services that cloud companies provide. The cloud is constantly being monitored for vulnerabilities. As soon as a flaw is seen, it is patched. All applications are updated quickly, removing the opportunity for malware attacks. The only problem comes with cost: while all cloud companies provide secure encryption options, they cost extra. Some businesses (mostly small, but the occasional large) opt for the cheaper, unsafe route of no encryption on their data. This has led to massive leaks, most notably the NRC leak, where the data of nearly 200 million voters was leaked. The lesson to be learned? Cloud computing is safe, but only if you pay for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there is something to watch out for. Often, cloud companies offer the opportunity for your data to be encrypted as it is stored. And obviously, for any sensitive data, this should be the case. Yet, many companies overlook the options (one of which is the encrypted data). This has led to massive leaks, most notably the NRC leak, where the data of nearly 200 million voters was leaked. The lesson to be learned? Cloud computing is as safe as you make it to be.

			<h3 id="z4.0">
				WiFi Networks
			</h3>
			<h4 id="z4.1">
				What is a WiFi network?
			</h4>
			<p>
        First off, Wi-Fi does not stand for “wireless fidelity”. It happens to rhyme with Hi-Fi (in fact, that’s where the term Wi-Fi came from), but the two are incredibly different. Wi-Fi, in brief, allows a computer to communicate with a network using radio frequencies. Due to the fact that the frequency is being transmitted through air (and not in a wire), anyone can intercept your communications.
			</p>
			<h4 id="z4.2">
				How can it be unsafe?
			</h4>
			<p>
        Especially when using public wifi networks (at coffee shops, hotels, or other businesses), all of your network traffic could be watched. The entire idea of public wifi is that anyone can connect - and, as a result, someone else could read/modify your data. These dangers manifest themselves in a couple of different ways:
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>
				1. Evil Twins
				</b>
				<br />
        A hacker shuts down a public wifi system for a minute and then puts out another wifi signal with the same name. When people connect to the new wifi, to them everything will appear the same, but that new wifi will track data and install malware.				<br />
				<b>
				2. Read the fine print
				</b>
				<br />
				Related to #3: Blindly accepting wifi terms and conditions may be allowing the wifi owner to track you or steal your data. While this won’t be the case at a starbucks or hotel, read through the TOS of seemingly shady networks.
				<br />
				<b>
				3. Lack of legal obligations
				</b>
				<br />
        No wifi network is legally obligated to protect your data, so many don’t. Use a VPN when going onto public wifi, and make sure not to send messages you wouldn’t want others to read. Additionally, If you install the applications of stores (Walmart for example), you give them rights to snoop on you.
        <br />
			</p>
			<h4 id="z4.3">
				Personal WiFi Networks
			</h4>
			<p>
        Now, these can be better. However, you’re still transmitting data over air that can be looked at. The best way to protect your Wi-Fi network is to utilize encrypted transmissions. The current standard is WPA-3, which will help maintain security for home Wi-Fi networks. Also, when in doubt, use a VPN (especially for high-security items).
			</p>
			<h3 id="z5.0">
				How do big companies store your data?
			</h3>
			<p>
        Google receives over 20 petabytes of data every day - enough gigabytes that you have to use scientific notation to write it: 2*10^7Gb
			</p>
			<p>
        That is an absolutely <b>ridiculous</b> amount of data, and google stores all of it, most with 2-3 backups.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may have heard of one of google's 15 data centers; massive borg-like complexes scattered across the world. Even looking at pictures gives one a sense of impossible scale - a physical representation of the vastness of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
				They’re safe, too. Facebook, Google, Reddit, Amazon: all of these companies have huge storage centers backed up multiple times over. When they receive your data, it is archived in one of millions of spreadsheets and other documents, able to quickly be recalled when needed. Facebook's data store, Scuba, creates and deletes millions of rows per second. Google spends billions - yes, billions - on its data center construction and maintenance. While you can’t always trust what they’ll do with your data (hyperlink to privacy), you can completely trust that your data will be safe from deletion.
			</p>
      <h3 id="z6.0">
        Phones vs Computers?
      </h3>
      <p>
        So we haven’t talked a lot about phones yet, and it’s important to mention them, because some phones can have security problems. And this is beside the fact that unlike computers (usually), phones are often physically stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, if you have an IPhone, you can basically just ignore this, because they’re pretty darn safe. However, if you have an android you’re a lot more vulnerable. This comes from the fact that androids are a lot more customizable - apps can do more interesting things, but in order to do so the phone has to give more permissions to the app. This makes downloading apps that aren’t on the official google play store very dangerous, as certain malware-infested apps can steal vast amount of info off of your phone. This is an often overlooked security issue, and being aware of the dangers of androids could save you a lot of money.
