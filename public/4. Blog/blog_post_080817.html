Before we even delve into the subject of net neutrality, let’s talk about the internet as a whole. We use it daily, from the average email users to the die-hard video gamers. It provides us the opportunity to communicate with others around the entire world, connecting previously separated culturesrelatives or friends. It serves as an invaluable education research, with websites such as Khan Academy providing free education for everyone. It increases ease of access, especially with the rise of online-shopping companies such as Amazon. As is pretty obvious, our current society is dependent on the internet - try to imagine going a week without using Google!
</p><p>
Now: Net Neutrality. Some of you may have heard this term floating around, especially in politics, but what actually is it and what will it do?
</p><p>
Net Neutrality is the concept that any internet traffic will happen without discrimination. Whether you’re a massive web company (Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc…) or a small start-up seeking to create its first website, your web traffic will be the same. The internet is “blind” - it processes all packets blindly, without viewing the material, just how the post office ships mail without looking inside each envelope.

Historically, Net Neutrality has always been a topic of hot debate. Internet service providers (which I will shorten to ISPs), which provide access to the internet for US citizens, have been caught violating the basis of net neutrality, causing in more harsh governmental regulations each time.
</p><p>
In 2007, Comcast was caught interfering with the traffic of BitTorrent, disrupting peer-to-peer communications on BitTorrent’s network. The FCC (Federal Communications Commission), in charge of regulation ISPs and internet access [check], responding by ordering Comcast to “end discriminatory network management practices”, on the basis of “[protecting] the vibrant and open nature of the Internet” [source]. However, Comcast sued the FCC and overturned the decision. Despite Comcast’s wrongdoings, the FCC simply did not have legal basis.
In 2010, the FCC formed rules against any prioritization against companies (from blocking and throttling, to paid prioritization). This time around, Verizon sued and these rules were once again thrown out in 2014. It was not until 2015 that the FCC made the critical decision to classify ISPs as under Title II of the Communications Act. The Communications Act was created in 1934 to limit AT&#38;T’s monopoly over the telephone market, but it proved to be a turning point for the argument of net neutrality more than 80 years later.
</p><p>
When applying Title II, the FCC chose to utilize something called “forbearance”, meaning that the FCC can enforce whichever parts of the act they choose. Thus, the FCC legally prohibited ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful internet content. Importantly, paid prioritization was outlawed, referring to the action of an internet “fast lane” (more on this later). Perhaps most importantly, ISPs were required to be “just and reasonably”, with anything that “is unjust or unreasonable is declared to be unlawful” (Section 201) [source]. In addition, anyone may directly complain to the FCC or directly sue an ISP for unlawful or unjust behavior (Section 207). This provides an important warning to ISPs - even if the FCC turns a blind eye to wrongdoing by an ISP, anyone can directly take the issue to the court, on the basis of Section 207.
</p><p>
Under Title II, the common internet user is protected from unfair treatment by an ISP, but Title II also upholds an important characteristic of the internet: equality. More than thirty years ago, the idea of the internet being an “end-to-end” network was developed. In its simplest form, this meant that the internet was formed by countless “end-to-end” connections, with the a simple path in between the start and end connection. At first, this proved to be the model of efficiency, but people soon began to realize a more important consequence: innovation.
</p><p>
This made an important distinction: when creating a website, the network would publish it regardless of the content. Thus, instead of seeking the approval of the network, an innovator would instead be targeting the market. It prevented a big monopoly from crushing competition. If people enjoy your product, it would succeed. Regardless of who you were going up against, you would have equal opportunity: the internet did not discriminate against which website to publish and which website would have faster connections.
</p><p>
This was in stark contrast with AT&#38;T, which utilized a different structural design. At the time, AT&#38;T had a system where the network owner could decide the usage of the network. Every message passed through the central authority, and AT&#38;T had the power to change any traffic through its network. Thus, any new ideas would have to be first passed by the company before it even could be judged by the public. As a result, new ideas were crafted to be liked by the few; they were tailored towards powerful AT&#38;T executives.
</p><p>
Thus, the “end-to-end” feature of the internet separated itself from centralized companies such as AT&#38;T. People began to pitch ideas for the general public, not just for the business executives. Moreover, new ideas were able to take over the market simply on the basis that people liked them more and they were more effective, instead of whether the internet service provider liked the service.
</p><p>
In its infancy, a program called “Gopher” was developed - think of it as way to navigate through various hyperlinks. For a while, every site used it as a way to post their websites. Everyone used the “gopher protocol” and everyone connected with one another as a result. Yet, with the advent of the World Wide Web (what we use today), Gopher quickly lost traction. It didn’t matter than it had dominated the market for years - it only matter that the World Wide Web was more effective and liked by people. In less than a year, 90% market share became 5% market share for Gopher.
</p><p>
Stories like this reveal the principles of the internet. It creates a place where the playing field is equal. Two well-designed websites act the same, regardless of whether they are owned by a massive company or a small start-up. With it’s “end-to-end” structure, the internet encourages innovation and creativity, arguably two traits that separate our nation from the rest of the world.
</p><p>
Net neutrality ensures the internet will continue as a breeding ground for innovation and creation. The current debate suggests the possibility of ISPs being categorized as Type I organizations under the communications act, removing the effective measures instituted by the FCC to keep the internet as it was when it was founded: the “end-to-end” connections that encourage innovation.
</p><p>
Net neutrality is what is defending our rights as American citizens. It prevents ISPs from creating an internet “fast-track”, where companies must pay more to maintain speedy connections to their websites. As has happened previously, this would allow ISPs to slow down any competition. For example, if your ISP created a movie streaming service, it could slow down Netflix’s connection to encourage you to use their streaming services.
